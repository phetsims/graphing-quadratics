# Graphing Quadratics - model description

_Explore_ and _Standard Form_ screens use the standard form of the quadratic equation:

_y_ = _ax_<sup>2</sup> + _bx_ + _c_

_Vertex Form_ screen uses the vertex form of the quadratic equation:

_y_ = _a_(_x_ - _h_)<sup>2</sup> + _k_

_Focus & Directrix_ screen uses an alternative vertex form, where _a_ is replaced with 1/(4 _p_ ):

_y_ = (1/(4 _p_))(_x_ - _h_)<sup>2</sub> + _k_
