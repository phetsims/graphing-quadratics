TODO list for graphing-quadratics

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focus & Directrix screen

IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make lines for terms available to point tools
Vertex and root points are clipped at edges of graph
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
Equations on each line on the graph, on outside edge of curve
Equation on directrix
Equation on axis of symmetry
Coordinates for vertex, directly below/above (outside curve)
Coordinates for roots, directly to left/right (outside curve)
