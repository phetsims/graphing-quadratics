Equations on each line on the graph, on outside edge of curve
Lines labeled with reduced standard form in screens 1 & 2, coefficients in decimal format to 2 decimals
Lines labeled with vertex form in screens 3 & 4, 1/4p in decimal format to 2 decimals

Make lines for terms available to point tools
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
