TODO list for graphing-quadratics

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explore: terms aren't clipped to graph
Standard Forms: initial state is out of sync with checkboxes
all: eyeball toggle doesn't control decorations, terms, etc.

FocusAndDirectrixInteractiveEquationNode
FocusManipulator
PointOnQuadraticManipulator
Equations on each line on the graph, on outside edge of curve

Reconsider scene architecture, because every scene is different

Make lines for terms available to point tools
Points, coordinates and manipulators are clipped at edges of graph
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
