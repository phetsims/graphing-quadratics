TODO list for graphing-quadratics

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New artwork for 'left' point tool

IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

F&D: make focus disappear when it goes off graph
F&D: force point to remain on graph
Equations on each line on the graph, on outside edge of curve
Lines labeled with reduced standard form in screens 1 & 2, coefficients in decimal format to 2 decimals
Lines labeled with vertex form in screens 3 & 4, 1/4p in decimal format to 2 decimals
In all equations, enforce the number of decimal places for values

Make lines for terms available to point tools
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
TODOs in the code
stringTest

KNOWN PROBLEMS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All screens: No equations on graphed lines.
All screens: Point tools don't work reliably.
Focus & Directrix: Equation is not aligned with sliders and it jumps around while updating.
Focus & Directrix: focus and point manipulators can go off the graph
