TODO list for graphing-quadratics

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focus & Directrix screen
Standard vs General form?
Should Focus screen equation be reversed, so that y is on left side?

Focus & Directrix screen:
> Add Vertex, Focus and Directrix checkboxes
> Change 'Hide coordinates' to 'Coordinates', off by default
> Replace 'Hide curves' with eyeball toggle button
> Remove 'Hide coordinates' from Decimals scene
X Should y term be on the left side, i.e. 4p(y-k)=(x-h)^2 ?
    Leave as is.
X What happens when p=0 ?
    Allow p=0, hide vertex manipulator, keep focus and point manipulators
X Are the manipulators continuous or do they snap to grid?
    Vertex manipulator snaps to grid.
    Point and focus manipulators are continuous.
X Slider increments?
    0.1 for all sliders
X What happens when focus manipulator goes off the graph?
    it disappears, drag cycle canceled
X Should “Point on Quadratic” automatically adjust to stay on the graph?
    yes
X No point tools?
    Add them for consistency
X No save/erase buttons?
    Add them for consistency
X default for 'Point on Quadratic'?
    I'll pick default value for h,k,p,point
X The equation (x-h)^2=4p(y-k) is referred to as “standard form” in the literature. Do we have a terminology problem with the “Standard Form” screen?
    Use general and standard terminology

> split first screen into 2, tentative names: 'Explorer' (decimals scene), 'General Form' (integers scene)
> add Vertex checkbox to Vertex Form screen
> make 'NO REAL ROOTS' disappear for y=0
General questions:
X Are point coordinates always visible, or do we need a “Hide coordinates” checkbox?
    yes
X Points have 2 decimal places, point tools have 1 decimal place. Is that OK?
    Fine
X What do we display when “Roots” checkbox is checked and y=0? (every point is a root)
    Create an issue for this

IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FocusAndDirectrixInteractiveEquationNode
FocusManipulator
PointOnQuadraticManipulator
Equations on each line on the graph, on outside edge of curve

Reconsider scene architecture, because every scene is different

Make lines for terms available to point tools
Points, coordinates and manipulators are clipped at edges of graph
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
