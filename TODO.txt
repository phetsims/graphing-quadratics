TODO list for graphing-quadratics

QuadraticNode should not be responsible for creating separate nodes for each quadratic term
Roots hide vertex on graph for y = 1x^2
Document unlink, removeListener, etc. requirements
Focus & Directrix screen

From https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/issues/10
Equations for each line on the graph
"NO REAL ROOTS” text on Integers scene of Standard Form screen, when appropriate
Sliders: snap to zero
Sliders: logarithmic-like scale
TODOs in the code
Draggable point connected to the focus and the directrix on Vertex Form screen
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
Internationalization (stringTest, maxWidth, etc.)
Implement disposal
