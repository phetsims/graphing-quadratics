TODO list for graphing-quadratics

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focus & Directrix screen
Standard vs General form?
Should Focus screen equation be reversed, so that y is on left side?

Focus & Directrix screen:
- Should y term be on the left side, i.e. 4p(y-k)=(x-h)^2 ?
- What happens when p=0 ?
- Are the manipulators continuous or do they snap to grid?
- What happens when focus manipulator goes off the graph?
- Should “Point on Quadratic” automatically adjust to stay on the graph?
- No point tools?
- No save/erase buttons?
- The equation (x-h)^2=4p(y-k) is referred to as “standard form” in the literature. Do we have a terminology problem with the “Standard Form” screen?
- where are coordinates displayed for 'Point on Quadratic'?
- why are there red dashed lines associated with 'Point on Quadratic'?
- default for 'Point on Quadratic'?
- Do we always have a parabola in this screen? If not, what happens?

General questions:
- Are point coordinates always visible, or do we need a “Hide coordinates” checkbox?
- Points have 2 decimal places, point tools have 1 decimal place. Is that OK?
- What do we display when “Roots” checkbox is checked and y=0? (every point is a root)

IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FocusAndDirectrixInteractiveEquationNode
FocusManipulator
PointOnQuadraticManipulator
Equations on each line on the graph, on outside edge of curve

Reconsider scene architecture, because every scene is different

Make lines for terms available to point tools
Points, coordinates and manipulators are clipped at edges of graph
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
