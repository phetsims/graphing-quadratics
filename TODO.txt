TODO list for graphing-quadratics

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focus & Directrix screen
Standard vs General form?
Should Focus screen equation be reversed, so that y is on left side?

IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove save & delete buttons from Focus screen
Reconsider scene architecture, because every scene is different
Make lines for terms available to point tools
Points, coordinates and manipulators are clipped at edges of graph
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
Equations on each line on the graph, on outside edge of curve
Equation on directrix
Equation on axis of symmetry
Coordinates for vertex, directly below/above (outside curve)
Coordinates for roots, directly to left/right (outside curve)
