TODO list for graphing-quadratics

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FD: 1/4p is in a slightly smaller font, OK?
VF,FD: (x)^2 when h=0 looks odd for vertex form equations
FD: feels odd that focus and point are continuous, but vertex snaps to grid
all: you don't see anything when you click the save button
E: initial state (a=1,b=0,c=0) means you won't see anything when you check term checkboxes
all: Center equation on tangent that is half the distance between vertex.x and edge of graph?

BUGS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#22 point tools problems

IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SF: Factor out Equation inner class in StandardFormInteractiveEquationNode, use HBox
VF: Factor out Equation inner class in VertexFormInteractiveEquationNode, use HBox
SF: Hide roots if they are off the graph
E: Make terms available to point tools
