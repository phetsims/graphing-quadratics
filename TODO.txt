TODO list for graphing-quadratics

The standard form is (x - h)2 = 4p (y - k), where the focus is (h, k + p) and the directrix is y = k - p.

DESIGN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focus & Directrix screen
Should graph controls be the same for both scenes on Standard Form screen?
Should state of graph controls be shared between both scenes on Standard Form screen?
Should roots be displayable on Vertex Form screen?
Use new point tool design in both GQ and GL?
Should sliders have more tick labels, so it's clear which one is non-linear?

IMPLEMENTATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equations on each line on the graph
Line[] in PointTool and PointToolNode is actually Quadratic[]
Point tool doesn't work on term-specific lines
Math for the point tool doesn't work for all quadratics. An example is -1 < a < 1
